This is an app about everything.  Review whatever you want, however you want, whenever you want.  You will be able to add tags, write a review, rate it, and eventually attach a picture to it.

As the app starts, please play start to initiate the app.

Immediately as the app starts, there will be a display of all of the reviews made so far. They can be sorted by clicking on the 3 buttons on top.  By clicking the search icon, you can also search for a specific "Everything."  You can set up the search criteria by clicking the button right below the search button.

Meanwhile, if you wish to see more details about a thing, touch the item on the list, and a more detailed dialog box will appear.  Please press the back button if you wish to return to the simplified list.
